You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.
Some weights of GPTJForSequenceClassification were not initialized from the model checkpoint at /gpfsdswork/dataset/HuggingFace_Models/EleutherAI/gpt-j-6B and are newly initialized: ['score.weight']

Some weights of GPTJForSequenceClassification were not initialized from the model checkpoint at /gpfsdswork/dataset/HuggingFace_Models/EleutherAI/gpt-j-6B and are newly initialized because the shapes did not match:

You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.
Using pad_token, but it is not set yet.
Some weights of GPTJForSequenceClassification were not initialized from the model checkpoint at /gpfsdswork/dataset/HuggingFace_Models/EleutherAI/gpt-j-6B and are newly initialized: ['score.weight']

Some weights of GPTJForSequenceClassification were not initialized from the model checkpoint at /gpfsdswork/dataset/HuggingFace_Models/EleutherAI/gpt-j-6B and are newly initialized because the shapes did not match:

You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.
Some weights of GPTJForSequenceClassification were not initialized from the model checkpoint at /gpfsdswork/dataset/HuggingFace_Models/EleutherAI/gpt-j-6B and are newly initialized: ['score.weight']

Some weights of GPTJForSequenceClassification were not initialized from the model checkpoint at /gpfsdswork/dataset/HuggingFace_Models/EleutherAI/gpt-j-6B and are newly initialized because the shapes did not match:
