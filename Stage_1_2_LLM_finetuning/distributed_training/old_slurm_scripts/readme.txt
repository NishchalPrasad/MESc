These are the files (.slurm) and their outputs (.out) which I used to run the training and testing scripts. I am uploading them exactly.
They may containg the name SIGIR_experiments as I was using an alias name for experiments for the initially intended publishing conference (which was SIGIR).
You can use these files to create your own slurm files or check for some details for your error resolutions (if they occur) from the terminal output of my .out files.

Some of the evaluation results in these .out (if they exist) files are erroneous as there was some logical mistakes when I first ran these scripts. 
Please refer to the evaluation results with the corrected logic (updated in the .\MESc\Stage_1_2_LLM_finetuning\distributed_training\dist_deepspeed_LLM_torch_lexglue_.py file) in the .MESc\experiments folder.
